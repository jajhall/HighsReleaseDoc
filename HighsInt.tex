By default, \HiGHS compiles with standard (32-bit) integers. However,
to allow larger models to be handled (with the exception of the
interior point method solver) it is now possible to compile \HiGHS so
that it uses long (64-bit) integers in all cases. This is achieved by
setting the \CMake parameter \code{-DHIGHSINT64=on}. The type
\HighsInt{} is then set to be \LongInt{} rather than
\StandardInt. Long integers are not currently supported by the
\Fortran interface. Since \HiGHS can be compiled with either
standard or long integers, integer values are referred to below
anonymously as \HighsInt.
