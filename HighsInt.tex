By default, \HiGHS compiles with standard (32-bit) integers. However,
to allow larger models to be handled (with the exception of the
interior point method solver) it is now possible to compile \HiGHS so
that it uses long (64-bit) integers in all cases. This is achieved by
setting the \code{CMake} parameter \code{-DHIGHSINT64=on}. The type
\code{HighsInt} is then set to be \code{int64\_t} rather than
\code{int}. Long integers are not currently supported by the
\code{FORTRAN} interface. Since \HiGHS can be compiled with either
standard or long integers, integer values are referred to below
anonymously as \HighsInt.
